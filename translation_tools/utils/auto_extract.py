"""
Automatic Translation Extraction for All Custom Apps

This module provides automatic extraction of translatable strings from SPA
React/TypeScript files during build and migration processes.

The extraction dynamically finds all SPA folders across all custom apps
by scanning for directories with src/ subdirectory pattern.

	Automatically extract SPA translations for ALL custom apps across ALL ASEAN languages.

	This function is triggered globally by bench build/migrate and:
	1. Detects all custom apps (from ManotLuijiu GitHub)
	2. Dynamically finds all SPA folders (any folder with src/ subdirectory)
	3. Extracts __("...") wrapped strings from .tsx/.jsx files
	4. Creates CSV files for ALL ASEAN languages (th, vi, lo, km, my, en)
	5. Leaves empty translation fields for manual translation

	Examples of folders that will be scanned:
	- m_capital/frontend/src/
	- m_capital/dashboard/src/
	- translation_tools/thai_translation_dashboard/src/
	- Any other custom app's SPA folders (dashboard/, admin/, etc.)
